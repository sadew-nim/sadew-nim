 Hi, I’m Nimz Bandara
I'm a 2nd year Software Engineering student passionate about coding, clean UI, and turning ideas into working projects.  

 About Me  
 
 I'm currently working on a **Java-based Car Parts Marketplace** and a **Tkinter Expense Tracker App**  
 
 Learning **Java**, **SQL**, **JavaScript**, and how to build real-world applications  

 Obsessed with logic, UI design, and making things look smooth and functional  

 Sometimes I get my hands dirty with real car mods too   

 Creating content at RevLogic — for those who live and breathe cars.
